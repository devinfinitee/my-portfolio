## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the new EmailJS package:

npm install
```

If you encounter PowerShell execution policy issues, run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

### 2. EmailJS Configuration
Your `.env` file already has the correct EmailJS configuration:
```
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_x29lji3
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_kgt44s5
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=CoddUcOgIV1ASGycY
VITE_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=+2348104639067
```

### 3. EmailJS Template Setup
Make sure your EmailJS template includes these variables:
- `{{from_name}}` - Sender's name
- `{{from_email}}` - Sender's email
- `{{message}}` - Message content
- `{{to_name}}` - Your name (Infinite)

### 4. Test the Application
```powershell
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` and test:
1. Fill out the contact form and submit
2. Check if email is received
3. Click the WhatsApp button to test direct messaging
4. Verify dark mode is applied correctly

### 5. Build for Production
